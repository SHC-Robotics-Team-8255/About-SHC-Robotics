# About SHC Robotics 

Sacred Heart Cathedral Prepatory High School in San Francisco sponsors
a robotics program that is affiliated with it's Inquiry and Innovation
STEM program.  The robotics program is somewhat between a club and a
team.  The program began in the 2015-16 school year and is open to any 
interested student.  As of early 2017 there are approximately 40 
students participating and the school fielded five (5) teams in 
competition this season.

## Robotics Platform Choice

SHC chose the [VEX
 Robotics](http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr?ref=hometile)
 platform for three principle reasons:

* Level Playing Field
* [Strong Curriculum](http://curriculum.vexrobotics.com/) 
* [Focus on Robot Performance]

### Level Playing Field
VEX competitions allow only VEX parts to be used.  Team cannot
manufacture, machine, or 3D print additional parts.  In FIRST
competitions those are allowed and new programs like ours do not have
access to the machine shops/equipment to be able to compete.  We aim
to build a program around VEX and add FIRST later as we gain
experience and resources.

### Strong Curriculum
VEX provides an excellent set of material for teachers to use in the
classroom and we aspire to expand robotics into more classes at the
school.

### Focus on Robot Performance

The structure of [FIRST competitions](http://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/judge-manual.pdf)
de-emphasizes the actual performance of the robot in favor of a number
of other judging areas (Inspire, Think, Inspire, etc).  We desired to
keep our program simple and focus on making robots work - as measured
by actual performance in the competition games - and add FIRST to the
program at a later date.

## Programming Tools 

Nearly all of our students use Apple computers and only one or two use
PCs.  The "standard" tools for doing [VEX
programming](http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/software/) include
RobotC and EasyC.  However, these tools operate in Windows on PCs.
An Open Source option that runs on Apple and Linux computers is
[Convex](https://github.com/jpearman/convex) but the learning curve to
install it and use it is steep.  SHC took the time to create
[Vexilla](https://github.com/SHC-Robotics-Team-8255/vexilla) to
simplify the installation and use of Convex.  

A key part of the choice of using Convex was the desire to teach our
robotics students real software development tools and processes and
not hide behind tooling that is only for hobby robotics.  While the
initial learning curve is slightly more complex using this path we
believe our students learn more and can thus do more by exposing them
to actual software development.
